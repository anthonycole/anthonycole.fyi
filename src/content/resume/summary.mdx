I'm an experienced Software Engineer with a breadth of experience in both Senior and Lead capacities. I've successfully delivered projects in large enterprises like Aesop and ANZ, and helped startups at stages ranging from pre-seed to scaleup grow.

While I consider myself full-stack, I have a strong passion for Frontend Engineering, specialising in React and TypeScript. I'm familiar with MACH/headless architectures and was also an early proponent of design systems. 

My current interests lie in strategies to decrease feature cycle time and costs, effective technical governance, and the use of Artificial Intelligence to create more effective teams.
